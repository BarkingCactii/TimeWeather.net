<p>This web server is served from my own machine at home with a static DSL connection from 
		<a href="http://www.tpg.com.au">TPG</a>
		. In my frustration finding a local hosting company that supports PHP and SQL at a 
		reasonable cost, I decided to set one up myself to see how difficult it was. 
		Needless to say, setting up these applications was time consuming and fiddly, but 
		nothing too difficult.

<p>This website exists for 2 reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>showcase the products I have written and hopefully make 
	a little income for my efforts</li>
	<li>to demonstrate to prospective employers that you don't 
	need 2 years experience to develop a web site</li>
</ul>
            <p>The site runs on Windows using IIS,
<a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and 
<a href="dev.mysql.org">MySQL</a> running on a Western Digital 
Raptor 10k rpm SATA hard drive with 2Gb Ram and a
<a href="http://www.draytek.com.au/">Draytek 2600+</a> router 
for those technically minded types. This machine runs 
everything; development applications, email, games ( and with a 
decent ping rate I hope! ). If it doesn't, make a nice donation 
through <a href="template.php?TB=buy.php">PayPal</a>, and I'll 
buy a dedicated machine.</p>
            <p>I am seeking casual employment in the IT field, 
            preferably in an application or website development role. I do 
have a job, but its night work. I wouldn't mind doing some day 
work as well.<p>Get my
